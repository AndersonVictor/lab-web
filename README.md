### What is this app all about?

Jsonld Resume is a free and open source resume builder that‚Äôs built to make the mundane tasks of creating, updating and sharing your resume as easy as 1, 2, 3. With this app, you can create resumes that are read-able and index-able by all machine learning algorithms and systems easily and accurately, print as PDF (single-page or multi-page), all for free, no advertisements, without losing the integrity and privacy of your data.

You have complete control over what goes into your resume, how it looks, what colors, what templates, even the layout in which sections placed. Want a dark mode resume?

Everything you type, everything you change, appears immediately on your resume and gets updated in real time.
